## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Audit stream provisioning
Audit stream subscription for ADO Git repository lifecycle events MUST be provisioned per operator documentation (`INGESTION.md`): Event Grid topic, ADO organization audit stream, Event Grid subscription with `subject` and `data.ActionId` advanced filters, and direct delivery to the Service Bus queue.

#### Scenario: Audit stream setup
- **WHEN** an operator completes audit stream deployment per INGESTION.md
- **THEN** Git repository created, renamed, deleted, and default-branch-changed audit events flow from Event Grid to the Service Bus queue as native Event Grid JSON
